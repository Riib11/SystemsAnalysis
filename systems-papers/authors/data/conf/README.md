The JSON files under the `data/conf/` directory hold information about each conference (one per file, with the filename being the short conference name). The data was copied from the conferences' web pages, with supplemental information from the CFP, the proceedings and its frontmatter, and sometimes directory from program chairs.

Empty fields (where not data was available or applicable) are denoted as empty strings or lists, according to the field's type.

### Field description {-}

* `key` (string): Short conference name.
* `conference` (string): Full conference name.
* `ogranization` (list of categorical strings): List of organizations sponsonring the event (only IEEE/ACM/USENIX are recorded since the rest are too infrequent to provide useful signal).
* `country` (two-letter categorical string): Country code where conference took place.
* `postdate` (date): First day of technical program.
* `last_deadline` (date): The last date when author could upload the full version of their paper for review (before rebuttals and revisions).
* `review_days` (int): The number of days between full paper submission due date and author notification.
* `submissions` (int): Total number of papers submitted for review. Papers rejected outright for formatting violations are not counted.
* `min_reviews` (int): The minimum number of reviews received by each paper.
* `total_reviews` (int): The total number of formal reviews written by the PC, overall.
* `double_blind` (bool): Whether the review process was double-blind, i.e., author identities were hidden.
* `rebuttal` (bool): Were authors afforded an opportunity to answer the reviews before final acceptance decision was made?
* `open_access` (bool): Whether conference is open access. Are all papers freely available to download?
* `age` (int): Approximate age (in years) of this conference series (trying to account for splits and mergers).
* `past_papers` (int): How many papers were published in this series prior to 2017. This datum was either taken from the ACM digital library, IEEE Xplore, or counted manually.
* `past_citations` (int): How many total citations have papers in this series received, at approximately the postdate. This information was also copied from ACM digital library or IEEE Xplore, where available. Note, however, that because of differences in methods of citation counting, they are likely not directly comparable to each other or to Google Scholar's count.
* `h5_index` (int): The "H-index" of the conference in the past 5 years, taken from Google Scholar Metrics, where available, at approximately the postdate.
* `h5_median (int)`: The median number of citations for papers in the h5 set, taken from Google Scholar Metrics, where available, at approximately the postdate.
* `notes` (string): free-form text with comments on the review proccess, if applicatible.
* `pc_chairs` (list of strings): Name(s) of the Program Committe (PC) chairs and their affiliations
* `pc_members` (list of strings): Names of the PC members and their affiliations.
* `keynote_speakers` (list of strings): Names of keynote (or invited) speakers.
* `session_chairs` (list of strings): Names of session chairs copied from the program (with repeats).
* `panelists` (list of strings): Names of panelists and moderators of panels.
* papers (list of dictionaries): Accepted peer-reviewed papers. For each paper, the following data were recorded:
    - `key` (string): A unique identifier combining the conference name and the paper's ordinal number.
    - `title` (string): Paper title, copied from the conference web page
    - `authors` (list of strings): Author names, and sometimes affiliation in parenthesis. The affiliation wasn't used for any features or training, but rather to help disambiguate among multiple scholar profiles with the same name, as described in the next section.
    - `award` (bool): Did the paper receive an award, such as "Best Paper" or "Best Student Paper"?
    - `artifact` (bool): Did the paper receive an "artifacts evaluated", "artifacts available" or similar seal? (primarily ACM papers; see https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging)
    - `topics` (list of categorical strings): List of keywords (see `topics.csv` for full list). These are high-level topics that roughly correspond to undergraduate courses in computer systems, such as "Operating Systems", "Networking", or "Security". They were manually assigned, and as such, likely include some errors, misrepresentations, and ommisions. Each topic had at least one conference focused primarily on this topic, although multi-topic papers are common. The following table lists the topic selection that was used.
