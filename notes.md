# Scripts in progress: Grepping for group B

It takes an average of 5.5 minutes per grep, where each grep searches for 20 papers from group B. So, the total search will take a little over 90 hours (a little less than 4 days).

And it finsished! Hooray! Here's the stats:

Papers searched: 38,138
Papers found: 11,731

This seems like it couldn't possibly be right though, since almost every group B search query found all of its targets. I need to see what I can make of it. THe 11,731 number comes from a `wc` on the tmp/gB* files.

Found what happened: ran out of space :(((( Left off around 500 somehting, about halfway through, so my original estimates were not bad. But itll have to run for the rest of the week probably.

- Ask Eitan or more space
